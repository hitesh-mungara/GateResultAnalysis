<p style="font-size:30px;color:red">Q1.When is the Examination Notice issued?</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><b>Answer</b> - UPSC Examination Notices encapsulate the Rules of Examinations
notified by the Government. Examination Notices of all the 13 Structured
Examinations are uploaded on the Commission’s website around 3 months
before the date of Examination. Examination Notices (indicative) are also
published in the Employment News/Rozgar Samachar. </p>
<p style="font-size:30px;color:red">Q2.What is the UPSC’s Annual Programme(Calendar) of Examinations/RTs(Recruitment Tests)?</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><b>Answer</b> – The UPSC publishes an Annual Programme (Calendar) of all the
Structured Examinations/RTs conducted by it at least 6 months in advance
(i.e. in June) for the Examinations/RTs to be conducted during the next
calendar year. The Programme is uploaded on the UPSC’s website as also
published in the leading news papers of the country. The date of issue of
Examination Notice for each Examination is also mentioned in this Annual
Programme.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;color:red">Q3.How to apply for Examinations conducted by the UPSC?</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><b>Answer</b> - Candidates can apply online for the UPSC Examinations by
accessing the online portal hosted on the UPSC’s website
(https://upsconline.nic.in).</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;color:red">Q4.How much time is given to the candidates for applying online?</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><b>Answer</b> – Time for applying online is clearly mentioned in the Examination
Notice. A candidate gets about 3 weeks time to apply online and can fill up the online application by following the instructions provided on the website for filling up online application.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;color:red">Q5.What happens if a candidate submits multiple online applications?</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><b>Answer</b> - While a candidate should avoid submitting more than one online
application, in case of doing so, the data provided in the last application
(highest RID Number), that is successfully submitted online, is accepted by
the Commission. All previous applications are ignored as these are
amalgamated with the last completed & finally submitted application. If an
applicant (who has already submitted an application successfully) wants to
make amendments in the application, then he has to submit a fresh
application on or before the last date of submission of application of the
Examination. Therefore, it must be ensured that fee is submitted against the
last online application only, which should also be complete in all respects
including its final submission. Fee paid against one RID shall not be adjusted
against any other RID number.</p>
